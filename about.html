                <div><h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Our goal at The Grand Avenue Cafe is to provide a comfy atmosphere with great food and drinks. Our menu features a book theme; most of the food items are named after classic book titles. This idea was crafted by the original owners: Thomas Knowlton and his kids. Now, almost 20 years later, the current owner, Debra Retallick, maintains this book theme. The Grand Avenue Cafe, located in Eau Claire, WI, offers guests a comfy and cozy atmosphere to enjoy their meal. We have lots of regular and loyal customers who have been enjoying our food and compant for years. We hope that after one visit, you'll fall in love with our caf√© just as much as we have.</p></div>
